      ## About this application

      ![Extra Terrestrial Phone Home
      Service](//howtodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/logo-et-phone2.png)

      This [Express](//expressjs.com/) sample application is modeled after a
      typical call center experience, but with more [Reese's
      Pieces](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reese%27s_Pieces#ET:_The_Extra-Terrestrial).

      Stranded aliens can call a phone number and receive instructions on how to
      get out of earth safely, or call their [home planet](//bit.ly/asogi)
      directly. In this tutorial, we'll show you the key bits of code that allow
      an agent to send a caller to voicemail, and later read transcripts and
      listen to voicemails.

      To run this sample app yourself, [download the code and follow the
      instructions on GitHub](//github.com/TwilioDevEd/ivr-recording-node).

      Let's get started! Click the right arrow above to move to the next step

      ## Route the call to an agent

      When our caller chooses a planet we need to figure out where to route the
      call. Depending on her input we will route this call to an extension. In
      this case an extension will be used to look up an Agent, so any string
      can be used to define an extension. 

      Once we lookup the `Agent`, we can `<Dial>` the agent's phone number and try
      to connect the call. Let's look at those steps next.

      ## Call the Agent

      This code begins the process of transferring the call to our agent.

      By passing a `url` to the `Dial` > [`Number`](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/number)
      TwiML tag, we are telling Twilio to make a POST request to the
      `/agents/screencall` route **after** the agent has picked up but **before**
      connecting the two parties.

      Essentially we are telling Twilio to execute some TwiML that only the
      agent will hear. Let's look at that next.

      ## The Agent screens the call

      When our agent picks up their phone, we use a
      [Gather](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/gather) verb to ask
      them if they want to accept the call.

      If the agent responds by entering any digit the
      response will be processed by our `/agents/connectmessage` route (below)
      which will `<Say>` a quick message, then continue with the original
      `<Dial>` command and connect the two parties.

      If the agent instead does not respond, the processing of the
      caller's `<Dial>` verb will end and Twilio will look to the URL we
      provided for more instructions - we'll look at that route next.

      ## Send the Caller to Voicemail

      When Twilio makes a request to our voicemail controller, it will pass a
      [`DialCallStatus`](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/dial#attributes-action-dial-call-status-values)
      which will tell us if the call was successful. If it was **completed** we
      hangup — otherwise we need to `<Say>` a quick prompt and then
      [Record](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/record) a voicemail from
      the caller. 

      We also specify an `action` for `<Record>`. This route will be
      called after the call (and hence the recording) has finished. The route
      will say "Goodbye" and then [Hangup](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/hangup).

      ## Record the Caller

      When we tell Twilio to Record we have a few
      [options](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/record#attributes) we can
      pass to the `Record` verb. 

      Here we instruct Record to stop the recording at 20 seconds, to
      [`transcribe`](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/record#attributes-transcribe)
      the call, and where to send the transcription when it's
      complete. Adding the `transcribeCallback` attribute to
      `<Record>` implies `transcribe = true`.

      Notice we redirect to an URL that is _specific to an agent_. This
      is a convenient way to specify which agent was called to produce
      this voice message. This way we can also save the associated
      agent together with the voicemail.

      ## View an Agent's Voicemails

      Once we look up the Agent, all we need to do is display all of her
      recordings. We simply bind the agent with its recordings to a view that
      is then rendered.

      It is possible to look up recordings via the Twilio REST API,
      but since we have all of the data we need in the
      `transcribeCallback` request, we can easily store it ourselves
      and save a roundtrip.
